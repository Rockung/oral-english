A: Can I help you, sir?
B: Yes, please. I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife.
A: What kind of presents do you want?
B: Actually, I don't know exactly. Do you have anything recommended?
A: OK. How about some very cool sneakers for your children? Anyway, it won't cost you much. It's only around $59.95 for each pair. It might be cheaper than that in America.
B: Hey, How did you know I came from America?
A: Just a hunch, sir.
B: How much again?
A: $59.95.
B: That's really cheap for shoes like those. OK, I'll take 5 pairs.
A: Sorry, sir. Because in this duty-free shop, your total expenditure cannot be over $300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife.
B: Oh, my God. I've totally forgotten about that. Anyway, I think she would like a bottle of perfume.
A: That's good. And I can also recommand you a good one. It's the brand of DKNY.
B: DKNY? That's very expensive in America. It costs nearly $70 for only 50 milliliters.
A: It's $60 here.
B: That's very unbelievable. Is it fake?
A: Of course not, sir.
B: OK, I'll take one.
