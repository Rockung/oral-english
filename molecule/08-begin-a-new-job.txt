Issac: What a nice uniform!
Kate:  Thanks, do you like it?
Issac: Not really. I was being sarcastic. Does it come with the job?
Kate:  Yes, everyone on the sales floor has to wear one. They're supposed to make us look more professional.
Issac: They're not actually that bad. They could be worse. What do you think about it?
Kate:  I don't mind it, actually. I don't have to worry what I'm going to wear everyday.
Issac: So are you enjoying your new job?
Kate:  It's much better than my old one. My new boss is great.
Issac: How do you like working in sales?
Kate:  I like the fact that I get to work with people. It makes the day go by so much faster.
Issac: That's good. Have you met Jane yet? She's the intern in the international travel department.
Kate:  Yeah, I've met her. She's a genius saleswoman!
Issac: I know! She could sell fridges to Eskimos!
Kate:  How do you know her?
Issac: She's my cousin.
Kate:  Why didn't you tell me about that before?
Issac: I don't know. I didn't think it was that interesting.
Kate:  Well, now that I know that, maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime.
Issac: That's a good idea. Let's discuss it after work.
