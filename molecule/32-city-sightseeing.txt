E: Welcome back. How was your vacation?
T: It was fantastic, but I'm glad to be back! Being a tourist is really tiring.
E: Where did you ending up going?
T: Because it's off-season, we got a really good package deal to Paris, so we went there.
E: I've always wanted to go to Paris. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world! Did you go to the top?
T: That was the first thing we did. I have a few pictures. Do you want to see them?
E: Sure. What's the picture about?
T: That is the picture of me on our fourth day of travelling. I am standing next to a famous fountain in the center of the city.
E: You don't look happy in that picture.
T: No, by that time, I was sick of sightseeing. I had enough of art galleries, cathedrals, fountains, statues and palaces.
E: So what did you do?
T: We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market. We had a few coffees, watched a movie, and we went for a swim in the pool of the hotel.
E: My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing. Did you go to the Louvre?
T: Of course! You can't go to Paris without going to their most famous art gallery! I was surprised by how small the Mona lisa was though.
E: That's what everyone says. I can't wait to see it for myself some day.
