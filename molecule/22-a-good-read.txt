Gracie: What are you reading?
Devin:  I'm just reading an old book called The Monkey King.
Gracie: Do you mean the famous Chinese story?
Devin:  No, it's based on the Chinese story. This is a piece of fiction by Timothy Mo.
Gracie: Who is Timothy Mo? I've never heard of him before.
Devin:  He's an amazing British author from Oxford.
Gracie: So, he's not Chinese?
Devin:  Well, sort of. His father is Cantonese and his mother is British.
Gracie: Has he written any other books?
Devin:  Yes, he wrote An Insular Possession and Sour Sweet.
Gracie: What's The Monkey King about?
Devin:  It's a novel about domestic tyranny and revolt. The protagonist goes from being very wealthy to having next to nothing, but like the Monkey King from Chinese legend, he manages to survive.
Gracie: That sounds interesting. Where does the story take place?
Devin:  Mostly in Hong Kong.
Gracie: Would you recommend it to me?
Devin:  So far, I would, but I haven't read the ending yet. I find that the last few chapters usually make or break a good book.
Gracie: Well, let me know when you finish. I'm always on the lookout for a good book to read.
Devin:  Sure thing.
