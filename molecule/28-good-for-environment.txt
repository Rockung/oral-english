Destiny: You're finally here! What took so long?
Patrick: I got stuck in traffic again. There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection.
Destiny: It's always rather congested down there during rush hour. Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.
Patrick: I don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.
Destiny: Perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport to work.
Patrick: I think it's something that I'll have to consider. The public transportation system is pretty good.
Destiny: It would be better for the environment, too.
Patrick: I know. I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.
Destiny: Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.
Patrick: The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.
Destiny: Well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.
Patrick: That's true. I could certainly use the exercise!
Destiny: So, are you going to quit driving to work then?
Patrick: Yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.
