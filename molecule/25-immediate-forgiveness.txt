A: Hello sir, how may I help you?
B: I would like to buy some flowers, please. Something really nice.
A: I see, may I ask what the occasion is?
B: It's not really an occasion, it's more like I'm sorry.
A: Very well. This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends. It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out. It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.
B: I think I'm gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear. What else do you recommend?
A: Mmm, well this is our "I'm sorry I cheated on you" package. Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies. The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.
B: I don't think that's gonna cut it. I need something bigger and better!
A: I'm sorry sir. but, what exactly did you do?
B: Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.
A: Get out of my store, you jerk!
