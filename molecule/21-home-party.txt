J: Hi, come on in. Can I take your coat?
K: Sure, thanks. I brought you a bottle of wine as well.
J: You are the first guest to arrive. I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink.
K: Should I take my shoes off?
J: Whatever you prefer.
K: This is a very nice place. How long have you been living here now?
J: Just over three weeks. Would you like a drink?
K: Sure, what do you have?
J: I've got white wine, red wine, gin and tonics, ginger ale, lemonade, orange juice, and sprite.
K: I'll have a glass of red wine, please.
J: One glass of red wine coming up.
K: So how many people are coming for dinner tonight?
J: There is just going to be 6 of us tonight.
K: Oh, I thought there were going to be eight. Who isn't coming?
J: Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last minute. Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well.
K: Oh, that's too bad, they're such good company.
