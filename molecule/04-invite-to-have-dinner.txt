Kelly: Do you want to go out for dinner tonight?
Nick:  Sure. Have you got anywhere in mind?
Kelly: I'm starving, so maybe we could go 
       somewhere with large portions.
Nick:  That Italian restaurant in the city center
       always has large portions. Do you want to
			 go there?
Kelly: I'm not really in the mood for Italian 
       actually. I was thinking about something
			 a bit spicy.
Nick:  If you want spicy food, then I'd recommend 
       going to a Thai, Indian, or Chinese 
			 restaurant. How about that Chinese buffet 
			 on Cowley Road?
Kelly: I really like that restaurant; you get a 
       lot for your money there. But, they've 
			 westernized their food, so it's not 
			 actually that spicy.
Nick:  You're right. Most of their dishes have 
       sweet sauces. We could try that Indian 
			 restaurant just down the road from us.
Kelly: The Taj? They're a bit expensive, but 
       they do serve large portions of very hot 
			 food.
Nick:  The Taj it is then.
Kelly: Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to 
       save some money?
Nick:  They'll still charge us a corkage fee.
Kelly: That's right. It'll probably work out to 
       be about the same then, anyway.
Nick:  Don't worry about money. I'll treat you 
       tonight.
Kelly: Are you sure? We could go Dutch.
Nick:  No, I'll pay. It's my turn anyway. You 
       paid last time.
Kelly: I won't argue with that! Let's go!
