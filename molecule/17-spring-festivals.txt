G: Hi, Jordan. How are you?
J: I'm fine, and you?
G: Yeah, I'm alright. Say, do you happen to know when Spring Festival is this year?
J: Yes, it's next Saturday.
G: Oh, good. I thought I had missed it. Are you going to celebrate?
J: I don't have any plans to celebrate. What about you?
G: I'm having some friends and family over for dinner. Do you want to come?
J: Sure. Are you going to do anything special to celebrate?
G: Yes, we're going to have a big meal together, play mahjong, and make dumplings together.
J: When do you plan on eating the dumplings?
G: It's a tradition in China to eat the dumplings at midnight.
J: I see. I've never celebrated the Spring Festival before.
G: Well, you should definitely come to mine this year then. We're going to set off some fireworks in the evening, too. It will be a lot of fun!
J: Ok, what time should I come by?
G: You can come anytime before 6pm.
J: Should I bring anything with me?
G: You don't have to bring anything, but if you want to, you could bring a bottle of wine.
J: Ok, should I bring some red envelopes for the kids as well?
G: Sure, if you want to. I'm sure they'd appreciate it!
