Jack: Is this your first time to eat at this kind of restaurant?
Joan: Yes. But I'm confused with so many items on the table.
Jack: They're quite different from those on a Chinese table.
Joan: Yes. This is a napkin, the big plate I know. What about those knives?
Jack: The big one, right next to the dinner plate, is the meat knife, and the fork is on the other side. The middle one is for fowl and the one on the far right is the fish knife.
Joan: Can I use one for everything?
Jack: Yes, but they don't do that.
Joan: Is that acceptable?
Jack: No.
Joan: What about these glasses?
Jack: The biggest one is for water, called a goblet. And the second biggest is for champagne; the two in the same size are for wine; and the smallest one is a sherry glass. There are sometimes not so many glasses. It all depends.
Joan: I know wine is popular in the west.
Jack: The spoon, you know, is for soup. They don't drink from the bowl directly. Those are condiments.
