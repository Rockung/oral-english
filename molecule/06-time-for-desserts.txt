Elijah:    It's time for desserts! Are you still hungry?
Katherine: I've always got room for something sweet!
Elijah:    What are you going to try first?
Katherine: I've never tried traditional Greek yogurt, so I want to try that first.
Elijah:    Do they serve the yogurt with anything?
Katherine: I believe they add locally produced honey to it.
Elijah:    That sounds good. I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu.
Katherine: Do you want to try some of my yogurt? It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece.
Elijah:    Ok. Mmm.
Katherine: What do you think? How does it taste?
Elijah:    It's nice, but it's rather plain. Do you want to try my tiramisu?
Katherine: Sure. I'll just have a bite.
Elijah:    What do you think? Does it taste good?
Katherine: It's absolutely delicious! That is the best tiramisu I've ever had!
Elijah:    I'm glad you like it. I don't care for it. Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas?
Katherine: Ok, I've had one of those before. They're really sweet and crunchy.
Elijah:    Do you know where they are from?
Katherine: I believe they are a local delicacy in the South.
Elijah:    Do you want me to get you one, too?
Katherine: Yeah, why not? We've already pigged out as it is!
Elijah:    Ok, I'll be back with two fried bananas in a few minutes. Wait for me here!
