A: Dad, something's wrong with our washing machine and a lot of clothes need to be washed. What should I do about it?
B: Ur, I am busy with my work. There is a coin-operated washing machine on the first floor. Let's go.
A: Coin-operated washing machine? That sounds interesting.
B: You just have to follow the instructions and put three coins in the slot of that washing machine.
A: So easy! Do I need to put some washing powder in?
B: No, you needn't. That's an automatic washer, all we need to do is just put the clothes in and then press the power button.
A: Does it dry the clothes too?
B: Yes. It spins and dries the clothes and also sterilizes them after that. Pick up the clothes. Let's go.
A: Dad, put three coins in this slot, right? Does it work if I put in two?
B: If you put in two, it doesn't work, and if you put in four, it will refund one. Believe it or not, see for yourself.
A: Dad, I put four in as you said, but it doesn't refund anything. Something wrong?
B: Oh, the coin gets snapped up. Let me see. Ur, press the button and then refund. Ok, have a try.
A: It still doesn't work. Ur, there is a sign that says we can call this number 80081234 if the coin couldn't be refunded. Let's have a try.
B: Well, forget it.
