Caroline: This computer!
Aaron:    What seems to be the problem?
Caroline: My computer just crashed again for the third time today!
Aaron:    What were you doing when it crashed?
Caroline: I was just opening up an attachement in an email about winning the lottery.
Aaron:    I think that might have been a virus.
Caroline: Oh, no! I thought it seemed a bit strange.
Aaron:    What kind of computer do you have, a Mac or a PC?
Caroline: It's a PC. Doesn't everyone have a PC in the office?
Aaron:    No, some people have Macs now, too.
Caroline: What's the difference?
Aaron:    PCs often crash from viruses, but it's nearly impossible to get a virus from a Mac.
Caroline: I didn't know that.
Aaron:    Has your computer turned back on yet?
Caroline: Yes.
Aaron:    Did you end up losing any of your work?
Caroline: Fortunately, I saved my work right before it crashed, so it should be OK.
Aaron:    You should probably call the IT department and have them check your computer for viruses.
Caroline: That's a good idea. I'll call them now. Thanks for your help!
