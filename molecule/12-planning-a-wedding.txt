A: Olivia and Nicholas are engaged! He proposed to her last time at a fancy restaurant.
B: I didn't even know they were dating!
A: After Nicholas' ex-girlfriend cheated on him, they realized that they had a great friendship and that maybe they were meant to be with each other.
B: They really are perfect for each other. I can't think of a better-matched couple than them!
A: I heard that they are planning to have an extravagant wedding ceremony in a church with a reception in an expensive restaurant on the lake.
B: Have they asked anyone to be in the wedding party yet?
A: I think Nicholas asked Jack to be his best man and Olivia asked Kaitlyn to be her maid of honor. They both have big families, so their siblings will be the bridesmaids and groomsmen.
B: It sounds like they've done a lot of planning in a very short time. Have they decided where they are going to go for their honeymoon?
A: I haven't heard where they will go yet, but I bet you they will go to a beach somewhere. You know how they both love surfing.
B: You know, most people find it difficult to find their soul mate, but they've made it seem extremely easy!
