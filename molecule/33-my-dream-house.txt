C: Have you ever seen Bill Gate;s home on the internet?
M: No. What's it like?
C: It's got its own library, theatre, swimming pool, and a guest house. The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control. It's also located near the sea, so he can park his boats next to his house. It's absolutely amazing!
M: Would you want to live there?
C: I think his house is fantastic, but I couldn't want to live there. You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house, plus a few people to take care of the gardens, and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children. It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own.
M: What's your dream home like then?
C: My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England.
M: Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself?
C: Old homes are great because they've got character. I think that's important.
M: Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well? Because they've got character?
C: No, that's just because I don't have enought money to buy new clothes all the time!
M: I see. If you lived in an old house, would it be decorated in a modern way?
C: No, I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state. I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history, and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more!
