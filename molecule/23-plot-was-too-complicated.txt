Brian:   So, have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies?
Trinity: Yes, but I didn't really like the third one at all.
Brian:   That's The Return of the King, right?
Trinity: Yeah. Even though the constumes were brilliant, I didn't think it was as good as the first two. What did you think?
Brian:   I thought the special effects were amazing, but I got a bit confused. The plot was too complicated for me.
Trinity: Did you read the books before you watched the movies?
Brian:   No. Did you?
Trinity: Yes, I've read them many times. I think that it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with the characters.
Brian:   Yes, trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me.
Trinity: I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home.
Brian:   Most movies are. Another problem for me was that the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles.
Trinity: That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries.
Brian:   I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars.
Trinity: Actually, they not only had 11 nominations, but they won 11 Oscars, too!
