A: Are you travelling in America?
B: No, I am here on business. I'll be here for almost a month attending conferences and seminars.
A: What do you do?
B: I'm currently the Head of Sales for a foreign company. So I stay busy with a lot of travelling and training of different branches.
A: I used to work in sales for 10 years. I know all the tricks of the trade. It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted.
B: Maybe, but it provides a great facet for me to improve my skills and increase experience. I've found that having great interpersonal relationship skills are key. What about you?
A: I am a reporter at a TV station.
B: How do you enjoy it?
A: It's a blast! I have decent working conditions and I've got a salary of $60,000 per year. Plus, the company pays for all of my travel expenses.
B: Which kind of stories do you chase?
A: I report the social news, which means I always interview citizens of various professions and trades, and get their outlook on recent social and political events.
B: Are you feeling drained?
A: Of course! I'm burning the candle at both ends. Important news happens out of the blue. Sometimes, I've got to jump out of bed before dawn to catch a story, or edit a video before it airs.
B: You have to experience this if you want to be an exraordinary reporter.
A: That's right. I am still wet behind the ears, but everyday gives me new experience.
