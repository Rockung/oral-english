Henry: Maria, I want to buy this suit. But I don't know which color is better.
Maria: I think the black one is OK.
Henry: Why? You know I don't like the color.
Maria: Yes, I know. But dressing is an art which utilizes the illusion of the human eyes to create a different look. You should learn to make amends for your weakness and exploit your strengths.
Henry: Maybe you are right. I'll take that black one.
Maria: Now let me help you to choose a tie that goes well with the suit.
Henry: Do I have to wear a tie?
Maria: Yes. It is necessary for men to wear a suit with a tie. It makes you look so attractive in a super tie. How about that flecked one? It must be the latest fashion.
Henry: I don't like flecked.
Maria: How about that striped tie? I think you may like it.
Henry: OK. Let me have a try.
