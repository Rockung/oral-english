A: If you can choose, will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese?
B: Why? Did Tom pop the question?
A: Not yet. But I wonder if I can get my parent's consent.
B: Let me guess, your parents want you to marry a Chinese man, right?
A: You are right. It is giving me a real headache. I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place.
B: I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex.
A: Oh, how did you deal with it?
B: I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend. But finally we broke up.
A: Oh, it's a pity. What was the matter?
B: Simple. We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences.
A: Like what?
B: He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family.
A: Oh, I see. In their culture, women should put family first.
B: Yes, he said it would be better for me and for the whole family. But I simple cannot quit working.
A: So that's why it's hard to have happy marriage with a foreigner.
B: Not really. There are many successful mixed marriages around us.
