A: What do you think about all the different diets people go on?
W: I don't think dieting is good for you. It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with!
A: But what do you think about people who are obese? What should they do to lose weight?
W: They need to eat healthy foods, but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do everyday. They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether, though.
A: So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate?
W: Sure, they can eat some chocolate. As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods, there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert.
A: How about drinking soda?
W: Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda. Soda should be a treat; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever. If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda, try some diet coke.
A: That's good advice. Have you ever tried taking vitamins?
W: My mother used to make me take vitamins everyday, but I don't take them anymore. Vitamins are good as a supplement, but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start.
A: How do you know so much about food and dieting?
W: You might not believe this, but I used to be twice the size than I'm now!
