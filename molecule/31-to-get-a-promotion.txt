H: How did your interview go?
A: Pretty well. I don't know if i'll get the promotion or not, but I feel good about it.
H: If you get the promotion, what will your new title be?
A: If I get the promotion, I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer.
H: Will you get a pay-rise, too?
A: Whenever you are given added responsibilities, you should get a promotion.
H: That makes sense. Who interviewed you?
A: My boss.
H: What kinds of questions did she ask you?
A: She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be.
H: The second one sounds rather difficult to answer. What did you tell her?
A: I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally.
H: Those are good answers. How did you react?
A: She told me that even when I become a senior engineer, I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team.
H: What do you think about her as a boss?
A: She's pretty easy to get alone with. She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally.
H: You're lucky. Not everyone has such a great boss!
A: That's true, she's highly esteemed among everyone at my company.
H: When you find out if you get the promotion or not, let met know.
A: I will do.
