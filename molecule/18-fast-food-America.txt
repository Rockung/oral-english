T: Catherine, have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation?
C: Yes, I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name.
T: It's very thought-provoking, isn't it?
C: Exactly. It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal.
T: So what do you think of the American fast food culture?
C: I think American really deserves the name of "fast food nation" - as people can find McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States.
T: And everyone knows that Americans' favorite food is the hamburger, isn't it?
C: Sure. You see, Tom, fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience. People just don't care whether it is healthy or not.
T: But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants.
C: What are they?
T: Such as fat-free milk, whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich.
C: They're much better.
T: But I'm not sure if they're well-received.
C: That's the point. People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal.
T: Well, Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods.
C: I suppose so.
