A: Good afternoon, sir, is there anything I can help you with today?
B: Umm...Yeah, I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend. Our fifth anniversary's next Friday.
A: Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her. Is there anything particular that you have in mind?
B: No, not really... I'm completely at a loss.
A: Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings, or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant. What is her favorite gemstone?
B: That purple one. I'm sorry..., I've never bought jewelry for anyone and I'm kind of nervous.
A: Don't worry, we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment. That stone is an amethyst. We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces. Take a look at this bracelet. It's 18K rose-gold, studded with amethyst and blue topaz. It's a great statement piece.
B: Oh...wow. That's really pretty, Jess would love that. But..., I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?
A: We have this beautiful platinum pendant, or you could also get her a locket. You could also get her a timepiece -- it's both glamorous yet functional. If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.
B: Jess? Well, she's very smart, and has a great sense of humor. She's very feminine.
A: Perhaps you could give her a ring?
B: Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me. I've just been so nervous.
A: Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propost!
B: Okay, I've decided I'm going to pop the question!
A: Fabulous! We should look at engagement rings then! Now that's a whole other section
