Estelle: Alright, tell me what you think.
Travis:  Don't you think is a bit bright?
Estelle: Yeah, maybe you're right. How about this outfit?
Travis:  This dress looks lovely on you, but it's not very practical, is it?
Estelle: No, I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance anytime soon, but I love the way it looks, I just had to try it on. What do you think about this? It's casual, yet sophisticated.
Travis:  I like the jeans, but you need something to go with the top, it's too plain on its own.
Estelle: How about this scarf, these earrings and an anklet?
Travis:  That might be going overboard a bit, how about just that scarf with the bracelet.
Estelle: That's a good idea. You have a lot of good fashion sense.
Travis:  Thanks, you'd be OK on your own. There are loads of fashion victims out there and you are not one of them. Have you tried it on yet?
Estelle: Yep, here it is! What do you think?
Travis:  That looks great, just on more thing, you need some high heels with those jeans. Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with the leapard print on them?
Estelle: The leapard print sounds fabulous, are they a name brand?
Travis:  No, they are a Prada knock-off for one-tenth price of the real thing.
Estelle: That's even better than the real thing.
Travis:  If I were you, I'd buy that now while it's on sale. If you spend more than a hundred dollars, you get fifty dollar voucher for more clothes.
Estelle: It's too bad I did all that shopping yesterday.
