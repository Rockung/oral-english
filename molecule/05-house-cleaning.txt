May:    Mom, should I put all of the old things in the box?
Mom:    Not all things are useful. It's up to you. If you think it isn't much use, you may throw them out.
May:    Ok, but it seems it's not easy for me. Many of them remind me of my childhood. I feel myself unable to throw them away.
Daniel: Come on. Go ahead, little girl. Be off with the old and on with the new.
Mom:    Do as you like. Keep some things that have more memory for you and some things to decorate our new house.
Danial: Oh, my God. It's unfair, Mom. May's job is to pack the bookcase, but I must clean up all the dirty things. We haven't used them for so long time. They are so dirty.
Mom:    Yes, you are superman, so we arrange something that is just suitable for a man like you.
Danial: There are so many things to doÔºÅ It's a pity that I can't be in two places at once.
May:    Never mind. You may want to do it faster or we will not be able to finish the moving in two days. But if we had a maid to clean the windows, it would be much better.
Danial: A maid? And clean the glass of the high building? Isn't that Spiderman?
May:    Spiderman works on the glass outside, and we just have to clean them from the inside. That's ok. And I told you I had called this room with the balcony.
Danial: Oh, come on. Nobody was there to see you call it!
May:    Uh, Mom, what should I do about the old newspapers? Nobody ever read them. And some of them were older than Daniel.
Daniel: Really? I'll have a look.
Mom:    You may sell them for some money, and share the money equally between you two. That would be your income for today.
Daniel: Oh, Mom, It's mean of you to pay us with little money.
