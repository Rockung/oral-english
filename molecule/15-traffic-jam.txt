P: Is it just me or is traffic getting worse, and worse daily?
D: If you think it is getting worse, then you are probably right.
P: It feels like there are more cars on the road every single day.
D: Congestion is typical in most big cities, but to be honest, the traffic situation in this city now is becoming ridiculous.
P: It took me 30 mins just to get down our main street this morning. Traffic just did not move.
D: The congestion is so bad during rush hour that even taking a bus proves to be dreaded ordeal now.
P: It is ridiculous! You can get places faster by bike than by a car now.
D: I think part of the problem is that more people can afford to buy cars.
P: Do you think the government will do anything to solve the problem?
D: They already ban cars that they feel are too bad.
P: That's a good start but they are going to have to do a lot more than that if they want people to be able to get around the city reasonably quickly.
D: Once the new subway lines are built, that should ease the congestion a bit.
P: What if it only makes it easier for more people to travel longer distance to work?
D: They ban motorcycles within the 2nd ring road. Maybe they could also ban vehicles.
P: Maybe. I am not sure what the solution is, but they'd better think of something soon.
