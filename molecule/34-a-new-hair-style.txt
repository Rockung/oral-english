Fred:     So, what did you have in mind today?
Patricia: I'm not sure exactly -- I just know that I want something different, a new hairstyle.
Fred:     OK, well, do you want to keep it long or go short?
Patricia: I've had my hair long for far too long -- let's go short.
Fred:     Do you want to be able to wear your hair up at all?
Patricia: I'm not that bothered about wearing it up.
Fred:     So, how about going chin length?
Patricia: Oh, I want to go shorter than that. I want a cut that looks drastically different from the one I have now.
Fred:     OK, let me think. You've got really nice wavy hair. Do you want to wear it straight or curly?
Patricia: I'm kind of sick of the curls -- Let's go with straight.
Fred:     How much time do you have to spend on doing your hair in the morning?
Patricia: Not much -- I need a low-maintenance cut.
Fred:     That narrows things down a bit. You've got great cheek bones that I'd like to show off... I think a pixie cut would look great on you.
Patricia: You mean the really short cut, like the one Emma Watson has?
Fred:     That's it -- short at the back and on the sides and a bit longer on top.
Patricia: I love her hair!
Fred:     You're not the only one who likes her new hairstyle. And it certainly got her a lot of attention. Sounds like that might be what you're after?
Patricia: Yes, you've hit the nail on the head. Do you think I could pull off such a daring cut?
Fred:     You definitely have the face for it. I think it would really suit you.
Patricia: What if I don't like it?
Fred:     Then you either get a wig -- or learn to like it!
Patricia: OK, well, it would be totally different from the cut I currently have.
Fred:     So, shall we go for it?
Patricia: It's now or never ...
