Colin, Abby

C: I have good news!
A: What is it?
C: I have an interview with an IT company on
   Wednesday!
A: That's fantastic! Have you prepared for the
   interview?
C: Not really. I have just looked over my CV
   a few times.
A: Let's practice a few questions.
C: Ok. Ask away!
A: What kind of applicant do you think we are
   looking for at our company?
C: The successful applicant must be hardworking,
   responsible, and honest.
A: Good. What makes you think that you would be
   a success in this position?
C: I would do well in this position because I
   have four years of experience working in this
   field, I am good at what I do, and I am easy
   to work with.
A: Ok, What are your salary expectations?
C: Oh, I haven't thought about that before. I
   guess I should. Well, to be honest, I don't
   mind if I start with a low salary because I 
   am rather desperate for work right now!
A: That might not be the best thing to say to an
   interviewer. You shouldn't ask for too much 
   or too little.
C: But I have no idea how much freelance IT 
   consultants earn!
A: That's something you should research before
   you go to the interview.
